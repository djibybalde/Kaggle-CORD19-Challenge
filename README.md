### AIM:
The aim of the exercise is to study the literature provided by the Kaggle in the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19) in order to answer a total of 8 taks. 

Our aim is to try to built a QA model that can answer all the CORD-19 tasks. 

This notebook is decomposed in 3 parts: 

   * 1st: Data Processing
    
   * 2nd: QA model: This model is based in the following notebook:  https://www.kaggle.com/jonathanbesomi/a-qa-model-to-answer-them-all
    
   * 3rd: Topic modelling  

This notebook was inspired on multiple works on Kaggle and Github.
